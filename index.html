    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>a French crescent-shaped roll made of sweet flaky yeast dough, eaten for breakfast. 
        Good croissants are light, buttery, flaky, and delicately sweet. Enjoy one with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate. 
        Golden, buttery croissants should be crisp and flaky on the outside and soft and tender on the inside, with a texture that can be almost pulled apart. 
        Croissants are often stuffed with different sweet or savory fillings. 
        The classic sweet-filled croissants use almonds, marzipan, or chocolate, whereas savory croissants might be filled variously with cheese, spinach, or ham.
